    # with array
        - for in --> index of array
        - for of --> element of array
    # with object
        - for in --> index --> object[index] ==> key: index & value: object[index]
        - for of --> can not print object 

5. spread
    - is an operator, defined with "..." symbol
    - using for array, to join all element of an array to a any position of another array
